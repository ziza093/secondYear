This is an example of an ASCII/UTF-8 text file.
It contains multiple lines of plain text that your program should identify.

ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
It's a character encoding standard that represents text in computers.
Most ASCII characters use only 7 bits, giving a total of 128 possible characters.

UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding that can represent almost every character
in the Unicode standard, yet remains backward-compatible with ASCII.
It has become the dominant encoding for the World Wide Web, accounting for over 95% of all web pages.

Your file detection algorithm should be able to recognize this as a plain text file
even though it has a .txt extension like all the other test files.
